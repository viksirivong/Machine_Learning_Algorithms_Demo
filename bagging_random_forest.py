# FILENAME: bagging_random_forest.py
# SPECIFICATION:    The program reads the file optdigits.tra (3,823 samples) that includes training instances of handwritten digits (optically recognized).
#                   The goal is to build a base classifier by using a single decision tree, an ensemble classifier that combines multiple decision trees, 
#                   and a Random Forest classifier to recognize those digits.
# FOR: CS 4210- Assignment #3
# TIME SPENT: 3 hours
